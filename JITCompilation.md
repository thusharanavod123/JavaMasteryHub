# Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation in Java

JIT compilation is a key feature of the JVM that improves the performance of Java programs by compiling bytecode into native machine code during runtime. Here's a detailed look:

## 1. **What is JIT Compilation?**
   - JIT compilation happens after the JVM loads bytecode. The bytecode is compiled into machine code that can be directly executed by the CPU, allowing faster execution compared to interpreting bytecode.

## 2. **How Does JIT Work?**
   - **Hotspot Detection**: The JVM uses profiling to identify "hot spots" (frequently executed code) and compiles them into native code.
   - **Optimization**: JIT optimizes code during runtime by inlining methods, eliminating dead code, and performing other optimizations based on runtime data.

## 3. **Types of JIT Compilers**
   - **Client JIT**: Optimizes for fast startup and low memory footprint, suitable for client-side applications.
   - **Server JIT**: Focuses on long-term optimizations, ideal for server-side applications that run for a longer period.

## 4. **Advantages of JIT**
   - **Faster Execution**: Native machine code runs faster than interpreted bytecode.
   - **Runtime Optimizations**: JIT allows the JVM to apply optimizations that would be impossible during static compilation.

## Conclusion
   - JIT compilation is a crucial feature of the JVM, enhancing performance by converting bytecode into optimized machine code during execution. Understanding how JIT works and how to tune it can greatly impact the performance of Java applications.
