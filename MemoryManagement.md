# JVM Memory Management

In Java, memory management is handled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) during the execution of programs. It involves different regions such as the heap, stack, method area, and more. Here's a breakdown of these regions:

## 1. **Heap Memory**
   - The heap is where objects are stored. It's divided into two main sections: Young Generation and Old Generation.
   - **Young Generation**: It consists of the Eden space, where new objects are created. The two survivor spaces are used for object promotion after surviving garbage collection.
   - **Old Generation**: Objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles are promoted here.

## 2. **Stack Memory**
   - The stack holds method frames, local variables, and intermediate results. Each thread in the JVM has its own stack.

## 3. **Method Area**
   - This is where class-level information, method definitions, static variables, and constants are stored.

## 4. **Metaspace (JVM 8 and above)**
   - In newer versions of Java (from Java 8 onwards), the Metaspace replaces the PermGen area. It stores metadata for classes and methods.

## 5. **Garbage Collection**
   - The JVM automatically handles memory cleanup using Garbage Collection, which reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.

## Conclusion
   - Understanding JVM memory management is crucial for optimizing your Java application. Tuning the heap size, stack size, and garbage collection strategy can lead to significant performance improvements.
